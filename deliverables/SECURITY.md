# SECURITY.md

Last updated: 2026-05-18

## 1. Security Goals

The Maintainer's Copilot is an authenticated chatbot whose users paste real issue text into it. That text routinely contains secrets people did not mean to share — stack traces with tokens, environment variables, signed URLs. The security model targets:

- No secrets committed to Git.
- All runtime secrets resolved from Vault at startup.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based authorization (`user`, `admin`).
- Audit logging for every long-term memory write, widget configuration change, and role change.
- A redaction layer that runs before any log line, trace span, or memory write leaves a service boundary.
- Hard refusal to start when required security dependencies are missing.

## 2. Secret Handling

No secret is hardcoded in application code.

`.env` contains only bootstrap values needed to reach Vault and configure local ports:

```env
VAULT_ADDR=http://vault:8200
VAULT_TOKEN=dev-only-root-token
API_PORT=8000
ADMIN_PORT=8501
WIDGET_PORT=8000
HOST_PORT=8080
LANGFUSE_PORT=3001
```

All application secrets are resolved from Vault at startup via `app/infra/vault.py::load_secrets()`.

**Verification:**

```bash
grep -ri 'sk-' backend/app/
grep -ri 'password' backend/app/
```

Expected: zero matches outside Vault-reading adapters and library-required field names.

## 3. Vault KV v2 Layout

Secrets are stored under `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/` in Vault KV v2.

| Path | Contains |
|---|---|
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/jwt` | JWT signing secret, algorithm, token lifetime. |
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/db` | Postgres URL with password. |
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/redis` | Redis URL. |
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/minio` | MinIO access key and secret key. |
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/anthropic` | Anthropic API key. |
| `secret/data/maintainers-copilot/langfuse` | Langfuse public + secret keys. |

Seeded by `vault-init` at compose startup from docker-compose environment variables (dev-only defaults).

## 4. Authentication

`fastapi-users` with JWT (Bearer transport).

Rules:

- JWT signing key resolves from Vault at startup.
- JWT payload contains user ID and role(s) only — no sensitive information.
- Every protected route requires a valid Bearer token.
- Registration is admin-invite-only. No public `/register` endpoint exists in the final flow.

## 5. Authorization

Two roles:

- `user` — log in, chat, view own memory, delete own conversations.
- `admin` — all user permissions, plus invite users, create/edit widget configurations, view audit log.

Role-enforcement mechanism: TBD (Phase 4.1). Permission checks happen in `app/services/`, never in routers.

## 6. Audit Log

Single `audit_log` table. Schema:

```text
audit_log(
  id           uuid primary key,
  actor        uuid not null,        -- user_id of the acting user
  action       text not null,        -- snake_case event name
  target       text,                 -- target identifier
  request_id   uuid not null,
  trace_id     text,
  metadata     jsonb,
  created_at   timestamptz not null
)
```

Audit-logged actions:

- `user.invited`
- `user.role_changed`
- `conversation.deleted`
- `memory.written` — every long-term memory write
- `widget.created`
- `widget.updated`
- `widget.allowed_origins_changed`

The audit log itself is read-only over HTTP (admin-only) and append-only at the DB level (no `UPDATE` or `DELETE` from the service layer).

## 7. Redaction Layer

Last updated: 2026-05-21 (Phase 3.5 / D-022)

A single redaction module at `app/infra/redaction.py` exposes one function: `redact(text: str) -> str`. It is called before any string crosses a service boundary:

- **Structured logger** — `RedactionFilter` is attached to the root `StreamHandler` in `app/core/logging.py::configure_logging()`. The filter mutates `record.msg` in-place before the `JSONFormatter` runs, so every log line — whether emitted by the `api` service or any child logger — is redacted. (Filter is on the handler, not the root logger; see D-022 for why handler attachment is required.)
- **Langfuse adapter** — `app/infra/tracing.py::redact_metadata()` wraps every `metadata=` dict passed to `langfuse.trace()` and `langfuse.span()` calls. String values are redacted; non-string values are unchanged.
- **Long-term memory writer** — will call `redact()` on the text field before the pgvector `INSERT` (Phase 4.3).
- **Short-term memory writer** — will call `redact()` on the turn content before the Redis `SETEX` (Phase 4.3).

### 7.1 Patterns

Eight patterns, compiled once at import time, applied in most-specific-first order. Full rationale in D-022.

| Pattern | Matches | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9\-]+` | Anthropic API keys | Placed before generic `sk-` rule |
| `sk-[A-Za-z0-9\-]{20,}` | Generic `sk-` bearer tokens | Hyphens included; 20-char floor avoids short identifiers |
| `gh[ps]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}` | GitHub classic PATs and server tokens | Matches `ghp_` and `ghs_` |
| `github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{82}` | GitHub fine-grained PATs | 82-char body per GitHub spec |
| `hvs\.[A-Za-z0-9]+` | HashiCorp Vault service tokens | KV v2 format |
| `postgresql://[^\s]+` | Postgres DSNs | Entire URI redacted (user+password+host) |
| `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}` | JWT tokens | Conservative 3-segment heuristic; 10-char floor avoids version strings |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+\-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` | Email addresses (PII) | Redacted per GDPR principle of data minimisation |

**Intentionally out of scope (deferred until used):** AWS access keys (`AKIA...`), pre-signed URLs (`X-Amz-Signature`, `sig=`). No production path in this project exercises these; adding untested patterns creates false confidence.

### 7.2 Redaction Test

`tests/test_redaction.py` — eight tests, all mandatory for CI green:

| Test | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `test_anthropic_key_is_redacted` | `sk-test-FAKE-not-real` (the graded mandatory string) never appears unredacted |
| `test_postgres_dsn_is_redacted` | Full DSN including password field is replaced |
| `test_clean_text_passes_through` | No false positives on clean prose |
| `test_log_filter_redacts_in_log_output` | `caplog.text` contains `[REDACTED]`, not the raw key; proves filter is active in the live logging pipeline |
| `test_github_token_is_redacted` | `ghp_` + 36-char body is caught |
| `test_vault_token_is_redacted` | `hvs.` prefix token is caught |
| `test_email_is_redacted` | `user@example.com` is caught |
| `test_multiple_secrets_in_one_string` | A single string with three different secret types produces ≥ 3 `[REDACTED]` tokens |

The mandatory grading criterion — `sk-test-FAKE-not-real` must never appear unredacted in any output — is enforced by `test_anthropic_key_is_redacted` and `test_log_filter_redacts_in_log_output`.

## 8. CORS and CSP for the Widget

The widget is the only public-facing surface that runs in a host's browser. Two layers protect it.

### 8.1 CORS Allowlist

CORS is enforced from the widget's `allowed_origins` field in the `widgets` table, not from a hardcoded environment variable. When the widget bundle calls `/widgets/{wid}/config` and `/chat/send`, the API reads the widget row, compares the request `Origin` header against `allowed_origins`, and rejects with 403 if it does not match.

### 8.2 Frame-Ancestors CSP

The route that serves the widget bundle (and the loader at `/widget.js`) sets:

```text
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <space-separated allowed origins from the widget row>
```

A host whose origin is not in the allowlist cannot iframe the widget — the browser blocks the embed at load time with a console error. This is the second layer on top of CORS.

## 9. Refuse-to-Boot Security Checks

The `api` refuses to start if:

- Vault is unreachable.
- Any committed eval threshold is set to zero or disabled (a zero threshold means "no quality gate" and is treated as a security/quality regression).

The `modelserver` refuses to start if:

- Classifier weights are missing.
- Weights' SHA-256 does not match `model_card.json`.
- `test_macro_f1` in `model_card.json` is below the committed startup threshold.

## 10. Defense Notes (Friday)

Questions to be ready to answer in the live review:

- Where does an Anthropic API key resolve from at startup? Show the code path.
- A user pastes a stack trace with a GitHub token. Trace it through logs, traces, short-term memory, long-term memory. Show the redaction test.
- The CORS allowlist lives where? Why not in env? Show the widget row and the service that reads it.
- Vault becomes unreachable while the app is running. What happens, what should happen, where is the policy? (Filled by Phase 1.4.)
